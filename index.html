          <p>
          I am a Software Engineer and Researcher living in Recife, Brazil.
          <br><br>
          My work so far focused on investigating Internet of Things (IoT) systems and possible solutions related to performance, especially fault tolerance, and data security. I have a strong mindset of using technology as a tool, whose goal is improving the quality our lives. Rather than considering that devices and systems should be developed individually, I prefer to see them as a part of an ecosystem that should be built with intercommunication in mind, and I reflect this in my work.
          <br><br>
          I worked as an undergraduate researcher under the Brazilian Institutional Scientific Initiation Scholarship Program (PIBIC), on which I had the chance to study potential applications of Blockchain and Smart Contracts in health care along with Security and Performance Solutions for IoT systems. 
          <br><br>
          For my graduation thesis, I worked on a proof of concept for an IoT ecosystem using microservices as a fault tolerant method. It consisted of two individual systems, which would then report to a third entity responsible for controlling and managing the devices connected to it. The main controller would be able to identify if any of the systems were reporting anomalies or if they had stopped working, by using a mix of heartbeats, hardware redundancy, and internal voting systems for modular redundancy.
          <br><br>
          Some of my research interests are neural networks, lightweight cryptography, cybersecurity in IoT, machine learning for low-energy devices and fault tolerant systems.
