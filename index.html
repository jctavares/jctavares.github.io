          <p>
          I'm a Software Engineer and Researcher living in Recife, Brazil.
          <br><br>
          My work so far focused on investigating Internet of Things (IoT) systems and possible solutions related to performance, especially fault tolerance, and data security. I have a strong mindset of using technology as a tool, whose goal is improving the quality our lives.
          <br><br>
          I worked as an undergraduate researcher for two years under the Brazilian Institutional Scientific Initiation Scholarship Program (PIBIC), on which I had the chance to study potential applications of Blockchain and Smart Contracts in health care along with Security and Performance Solutions for IoT systems. 
          <br><br>
          For my graduation thesis, I worked on a proof of concept for an IoT ecosystem using microservices as a fault tolerant method. It consisted of two individual systems, which would then report to a third entity responsible for controlling and managing the devices connected to it, while also using concepts such as heartbeat, hardware redundancy and internal voting system for modular redundancy.
          <br><br>
          Some of my research interests are neural networks, lightweight cryptography, cybersecurity in IoT, machine learning for low-energy devices and fault tolerant systems.
          <br><br>
          Feel free to reach out to me in english (advanced), portuguese (native) or japanese (N2).
