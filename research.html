            <h3> Investigation on the use of Smart Contracts, based on the blockchain paradigm, in healthcare, especially in physiotherapy and rehabilitation </h3>
             <b>Keywords:</b> blockchain, smart contracts, consensus algorithm
            <br> <b>Abstract:</b>
            Over the years, manual activities developed and performed by human beings have been digitized and automated by computers. This process of digital transformation and adaptation decreases the dependence on human reliability, reduces costs and minimizes impacts from unpredictable nature phenomena. Though virtual environments may provide ease and ease and many advantages, the process is not rethink to happen digitally. This research aims to investigate how smart contracts, through the blockchain paradigm, can be applied to improve data management in healthcare.            <br>

            <h3> Investigation on Performance and Security Solutions for Internet of Things Systems </h3>
             <b>Keywords:</b> internet of things, iot, protocols, smart city, edge computing, cloud computing, fog computing
            <br> <b>Abstract:</b>
            The industrial revolutions signaled the transition between different phases of society, bringing technological advances that were able to transform the environment they were present in. The Third Industrial Revolution, also known as the "Digital Revolution", was responsible for the continuous development of computers and industrial automation at that time, a decisive factor in expanding the state of the art of technology and leading to the current phase called "Industry 4.0," which focuses on efficiency and productivity of processes. One of the concepts responsible for ensuring these advances and improvements is the Internet of Things (IoT), which involves interconnecting smart objects through networks to exchange data that can generate relevant information about a particular application. This research aims to investigate possible solutions that can positively impact performance and ensure the security of data collected by these types of devices.            <br>

            <h3> Software fault tolerance using microservices architecture in the Internet of Things </h3>
             <b>Keywords:</b> internet of things, iot, fault tolerance, microservices architecture
            <br> <b>Abstract:</b>
            The Internet of Things is one of the most important concepts on the state of
art of the "Industry 4.0". Smart objects, found in households, industry and research
environments, are building technological ecosystems and are less seen as individual
devices alone. Even though the applications are mostly device-driven, software
disponibility is a crucial factor for success or failure. In this regard, software fault
tolerance has a significant role, allowing that systems continue to work under faulty
conditions, while the modularization brought by microservice architectures supports
it.            <br>
